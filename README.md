# Summary

This project includes a full report as for the reasons why we conducted it. A short summary would be that we wanted to investigate methods useful for data analytics based on machine learning and how to make the most of it. We used the NLP and sentiment analysis task as a proxy, answering the question : how can sentiment analysis can give us insights on textual data ? 


## List
This code provides :
* Allocin√© scraping
* Wikipedia bilingual sampling
* Twitter sampling
* Features module to process supervised or unsupervised text csv
* Classifiers used for sentiment analysis regression and random search script for meta-parameters tuning
* Plotting and analysis tools

## How to run
Basically all of the aforementioned features are implemented in the corresponding module_name.py

To use most features, one need to create approriate directory in a data/ directory.
To use Twitter, one need to use twitter api keys and save them in a text file named data/twitter/twitter_api_keys.tkt
